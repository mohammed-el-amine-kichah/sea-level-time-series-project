# Sea Level Rise - Time Series Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes historical sea level rise data using time series modeling. The goal is to explore trends, fit predictive models, and forecast future sea level changes.

## Dataset
- **Source**: [DataHub - Sea Level Rise](https://datahub.io/core/sea-level-rise)
- **Contents**: Global mean sea level measurements over time.
- **Time Span**: 1850-2014
- **Sampling Frequency**: Annual

## Project Structure
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter/Colab notebooks for data exploration, modeling, and forecasting.
- `data/` - Raw and processed datasets.
- `models/` - Saved models for predictions.
- `results/` - Graphs, tables, and final reports.

## Methodology
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualizing trends and seasonality.
   - Checking for missing values and outliers.

2. **Model Specification**
   - Identifying suitable time series models (ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, etc.).
   - Performing stationarity tests.

3. **Model Fitting & Diagnostics**
   - Training candidate models and evaluating residuals.
   - Choosing the best-performing model.

4. **Forecasting**
   - Making future predictions.
   - Comparing forecasts to actual values.

5. **Discussion**
   - Interpreting results and limitations.
   - Implications of sea level trends.

## Tools & Libraries
- **R**: 
  - `tidyverse` (Data manipulation & visualization)
  - `forecast` (Time series modeling)
  - `tseries` (Stationarity tests)
  - `ggplot2` (Visualizations)
  - `TSstudio` (Time series analysis)
